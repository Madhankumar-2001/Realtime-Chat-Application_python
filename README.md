## Aim

Build a real-time chat application using WebSocket technology to enable real-time communication.

## Description

This project involves developing a real-time chat application that allows users to communicate instantly using WebSocket technology. The application facilitates real-time messaging without storing chat history in a database. It is designed to demonstrate the core concepts of WebSocket communication and the development of real-time applications.

### Features

- **Real-Time Communication**: Enables instant messaging between users.
- **WebSocket Technology**: Utilizes WebSockets for real-time, bidirectional communication.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Provides a simple and intuitive interface for users to chat.
- **No Database Storage**: Displays chat messages in real-time without persisting them in a database.

### Technologies

- **Python**: The core programming language used for developing the chat application.
- **Flask/Django**: Web frameworks used to build the server-side of the application.
- **WebSockets**: For real-time communication between clients and the server.

### What You Learn

- **WebSocket Communication**: Understand how WebSockets work for real-time, bidirectional communication.
- **Real-Time Applications**: Gain experience in developing applications that require real-time data exchange.
- **Flask/Django**: Learn to use these web frameworks to create robust server-side applications.

### How It Works

1. **Setup WebSocket Server**: Use Flask or Django to set up a WebSocket server.
2. **Client Connection**: Clients connect to the server via WebSockets.
3. **Real-Time Messaging**: Messages sent by one user are instantly broadcasted to all connected users.
4. **Display Messages**: Messages are displayed in real-time on the user's screen without any delay.

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Run the server to start the chat application.
4. Open multiple client windows to start chatting in real-time.

### Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Flask/Django
- Flask-SocketIO/Django Channels (for WebSocket support)
